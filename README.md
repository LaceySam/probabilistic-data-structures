# This isn't the package you're looking for...

This package is just something I've thrown together to cement in an
understanding of various probabilistic data structures. Whilst everything in
this package should work; nothing has been exhaustivly tested, optimised and
probably miss a trick here and there.

## Hyper Log Log

A good paper on the subject: http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40671.html

If you're looking for a Go library I recomend:
https://github.com/clarkduvall/hyperloglog

Its ~4x faster, ~1.5% more accurate than my implementation and very easy to use.
